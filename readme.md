monad
--

A (hopefully) pragmatic implementation of some useful
monads. Looking to define the generic typeclass for them
in the near future.

For an explanation of Monads, feel free to peruse the
internet for the dozens of tutorials on the subject.
A favorite of mine is the text, "Learn You a Haskell
for Great Good".

A short note
--
Monads can be a weird, scary concept at first. But they
are a very powerful pattern for structuring computation.
Hopefully this library is of use to some, if only to learn
something new.
