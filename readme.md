maybe 
--
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/superfunc/maybe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/superfunc/maybe)

An implementation of the maybe type, also 
known as option or optional in other languages. 

The benefit provided by such a type is the ability to
encapsulate otherwise tedious chain of if/else checks,
for a concrete example of this, see the following 
[sample code](src/examples/example.nim).


## Installation
Should be installed via [nimble](http://github.com/nimrod-code/nimble)
