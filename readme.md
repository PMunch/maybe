maybe
--

A (hopefully) pragmatic implementation of the maybe 
monad, also known as optional in other languages. 

Monads can be a weird, scary concept at first. But they
are a very powerful pattern for structuring computation.
Maybe is a very concrete, simple example of the pattern
that can help structure our code. For examples of this,
see the examples/ folder.
